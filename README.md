# CS583F19_2D_Game_Alfiler_A_TimelessDelve
#How to play:
 - Move by using arrow keys.
 - Press X in the direction of the block that you want to break, in order to break it.
 - Movement will cause your fuel to decrease, so in order to prevent yourself from running out of fuel,
   collect coal by breaking coal blocks and collecting coal, which will add 35% to your fuel.
 - If you happen to run out of fuel, this essentiall stands as a failure / loss, and game will restart. 
 - Delve deeper in order to collect ores and gems (gold,diamond,ruby,emerald,draconic,light), which will
   then lead to your victory.

#Citations for used assets:
 - I used the dirt tile from BayatGames' "Free Platform Game Assets" throughout my game, and used GIMP 
    in order to edit it to create the rest of my tiles to my liking.
 - I used a 2d coal, diamond, and emerald art from google along with a light effect in order to create my
    prefabs along by using GIMP to strip the backgrounds / edit.
	- I also used these images to create more tiles (coal/gold/diamond/ruby/emerald/draconic/light ores)
	   using GIMP.
 - I found a nice starry background that I used for the background practically the entire game
 - The rocket art that the serves as the player was also found on google
 - Cinemachine for 2d camera movement
